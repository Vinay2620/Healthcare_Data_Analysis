# Healthcare_Data_Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze patient data from a healthcare facility using Power BI. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights to improve patient management and operational efficiency. The analysis focuses on various key metrics, such as patient wait times, satisfaction scores, and the distribution of administrative versus non-administrative appointments.

### Objectives
- **Visualize Patient Data:** Create a comprehensive dashboard to visualize patient data, enabling healthcare administrators to make data-driven decisions.
- **Monitor Key Metrics:** Track patient wait times, satisfaction scores, and the ratio of referred to non-referred patients.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard:** An interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore the data through various visualizations, filters, and slicers.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of key metrics to facilitate prompt decision-making.
- **DAX Calculations:** Implementation of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom calculations and metrics.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query:** For data cleansing and preparation.
- **DAX:** For advanced calculations and data manipulation.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data visualization and analysis in the healthcare sector. By leveraging Power BI, healthcare facilities can gain deep insights into their operations, ultimately leading to better patient care and more efficient management.
